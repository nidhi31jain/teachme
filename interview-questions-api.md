* What is kick-starter project templates?

      It allows a developer to start writing a project without writing much code but just selecting the components s/he wants to use for ex logging,error handling, dependencies etc. Also can specify the package name, version etc. So they mainly have to focus on business functions. 

* What is Api well-defined best practices?


        Use nouns but no verbs. ...
        GET method and query parameters should not alter the state. ...
        Use plural nouns. ...
        Use sub-resources for relations. ...
        Use HTTP headers for serialization formats. ...
        Use HATEOAS. ...(hypertext links should be used to create a better navigation through the API.)
        Provide filtering, sorting, field selection and paging for collections.

* What do you mean by fault tolerant?

          Fault tolerance is the property that enables a system to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of           (or one or more faults within) some of its components.

* What do you mean by elastically scalable?

          Scalability: "Increasing" the capacity to meet the "increasing" workload.

          Elasticity: "Increasing or reducing" the capacity to meet the "increasing or reducing" workload
          Scalability: Scalability enables a corporate to meet expected demands for services with "long-term, strategic                 needs".

          Elasticity: Elasticity enables a corporate to meet unexpected changes in the demand for services with "short-term,             tactical needs".

* What do you mean by highly distributed?

* What do you mean by safe, secure, how you going to add security in api/application?

* Develop enhancements to existing routing, discovery and security API framework

* What is cloud technologies (IaaS, PaaS)

* What is serverless technologies

            Serverless computing is a cloud-computing execution model in which the cloud provider runs the server, and                    dynamically manages the allocation of machine resources. Pricing is based on the actual amount of resources                     consumed by an application, rather than on pre-purchased units of capacity.

* How you enhance standards and improve process efficiency through automation? Example and what you can do for it?

* What is development of 12 factor apps, explain with example?

            
            12 factors developers should think about when building native cloud apps.

            1. Code base
            Use one codebase, even when building cross-platform apps. Address the needs of specific devices with version control.

            2. Dependencies
            Explicitly declare and isolate all dependencies. 

            3. Configuration
            Don’t store config as constants in code. Instead, design the app to read its config from the environment.

            4. Backing Services
            Treat back-end services as attached resources to be accessed with a URL or other locator stored in config.

            5. Build, Release, Run
            Strictly separate build and run stages.

            6. Processes
            Execute the app as one or more stateless processes. Data that must be persistent should be stored in a stateful backing service.

            7. Port binding
            Use port binding to export services.

            8. Concurrency
            Scale out apps horizontally, not vertically. 

            9. Disposability
            Use fast startups and graceful shutdowns to maximize robustness.

            10. Parity
            Facilitate continuous deployment by ensuring that development, staging, and production environments are as similar as possible.

            11. Logs
            Treat logs as event streams. Logs should not be concerned with routing or storing the app’s output.

            12. Admin processes
            Run admin tasks as one-off processes from a machine in the production environment that’s running the latest production code.



* Do you have Solid grasp of the fundamentals of micro services architectures? Give me an example?

* What is cloud native applications, what benefit it brings, any experience of building that?

* What is Object Oriented Programming Principles, give  me example of few principle with example?

* What is micro service?

             Microservices Concept. Microservices architecture consists of collections of light-weight, loosely-coupled                    services. Each service implements a single business capability. Ideally, these services should be cohesive enough              to develop, test, release, deploy, scale, integrate, and maintain independently.
